# Bakery Shop Chatbot

This project implements a simple bakery shop chatbot using Python's `tkinter` library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The chatbot interacts with users by answering questions related to the bakery’s menu, hours of operation, location, and order process.

## Features
- **Menu Information**: Users can ask about the bakery's available items like bread, cakes, cookies, and pastries.
- **Business Hours**: Provides the bakery's working hours.
- **Location**: Gives the address of the bakery.
- **Order Information**: Explains how users can place orders.
- **Friendly Chat**: Responds politely to user queries with simple, pre-defined responses.
- **User Interaction**: Provides a chat-like interface for smooth interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for this project.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI library for building the chat interface.
- **ScrolledText**: For a scrollable chat window to display user and bot messages.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pavanakv/bakery-shop-chatbot.git
    cd bakery-shop-chatbot
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python chatbot_bakeryshop_gui.py
    ```

3. The application will launch a window where you can interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

Once the application is running:
- Type your questions or queries in the text box (e.g., "What is on the menu?", "Where is the bakery located?", "How can I place an order?").
- Press the "Send" button to receive a response from the chatbot.
- The conversation will be displayed in the chat window.

### Example Conversations:
- **User**: "What is on the menu?"
- **Bot**: "We have a variety of fresh bread, cakes, cookies, and pastries."

- **User**: "Where is the bakery located?"
- **Bot**: "We are located at Bakery Town, Bangalore"

- **User**: "How can I place an order?"
- **Bot**: "You can place an order by visiting our shop or calling us at (555) 123-4567."

## Enhancements for Future Versions
- **Natural Language Processing**: Integrate NLP to handle a broader range of queries and make the bot more conversational.
- **Order Management**: Allow users to directly place orders through the chatbot.
- **UI Enhancements**: Add more advanced features to the GUI such as buttons for quick responses or image support for menu items.
